Here, you will find the implementation of all regression methods for the course enrollment prediction task provided in the paper. 
Explanation of each Python file:

preprocess.py --> preprocess the training, validation, and test data.
offered_courses.py --> Calculate the offered course list for each semester from all the data. 
utils.py --> post-processing function to filter out if a course is not offered in the target semester or if a student took a course in prior semesters to recommend new courses.
model_name.py--> Implement the regression algorithm (provided in each folder) and calculate MAE and RMSE for all courses in target semesters. 
model_name_CIS.py--> Implement the regression algorithm (provided in each folder) and calculate MAE and RMSE for CIS Departmental courses in target semesters.
