Here, you will find the implementation of predict from classifier method using Logistic Regression algorithm for the course enrollment prediction task provided in the paper. 
Explanation of each Python file:

preprocess.py --> preprocess the training, validation, and test data.
offered_courses.py --> Calculate the offered course list for each semester from all the data. 
utils.py --> post-processing function to filter out if a course is not offered in the target semester or if a student took a course in prior semesters to recommend new courses.
Logistic_regression.py--> Implement the Logistic Regression algorithm and re-purpose the classification output to estimate number of enrollments in courses and calculate MAE and RMSE for all courses in target semesters. 
Logistic_regression_CIS.py--> Implement the Logistic Regression algorithm and re-purpose the classification output to estimate number of enrollments in CIS Departmental courses and calculate MAE and RMSE for CIS courses in target semesters.
